# wavewire

TUI audio visualization, routing, and processing tool

## Stack
- Rust
- PipeWire (via JACK API for compatibility)
- Vulkan rendering (maybe - profile first, CPU might be fine)
- TUI framework (TBD)

## Core Features
- Real-time frequency spectrum visualization
- Virtual audio devices (ins/outs)
- Route physical/virtual devices together
- Audio filters (noise gate, EQ, etc.)
- Fast, lightweight, instant startup

## Technical TODO
- Choose TUI framework (ratatui, cursive, etc.)
- FFT library for frequency analysis
- JACK API bindings (`jack` crate)
- Audio buffer management
- Graph-based routing system
- Filter DSP implementations

## Open Questions
- CPU rendering vs Vulkan for visualizations (profile first)
- Real-time vs buffered visualization
- How to handle sample rate mismatches
- Session persistence (save/load routing configs)
